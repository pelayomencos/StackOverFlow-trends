/* Most questions have concerned MySQL which has clearly been the most popular topic throughout the years.
  The last few years have however seen a decrease in the questions concerning MySQL and a rise in questions
  about PostgreSQL â€“ the distance between number of questions of MySQL and other SQL languages has never been 
  smaller.

--5. What hour of the day are questions asked?
