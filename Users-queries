-- 1. Where in the world are most of the users from? 
SELECT COUNT(location)
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`

-- We only have the location for around 20% of the users! 

SELECT location, COUNT(location) AS location_frequency

GROUP BY location 
ORDER BY COUNT(location) DESC
LIMIT 15;

/* 4 of the 5 most frequent locations are in India. 
However this data is of no use for us due to:
1. Missing data (80%)
2. Unreliable tags (e.g. many tags indicate a region or a city
[New York] without mentioning the country [USA], which makes it 
hard to see the actual number of users of a given country)

--2. When did users join Stack OverFlow?
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM creation_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS new_users
FROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
